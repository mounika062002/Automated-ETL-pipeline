# ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow

The ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow is a data engineering project that automates the process of extracting raw data, transforming it into structured formats, and loading it into a target database. It leverages Airflow DAGs for orchestration, ensuring reliability, scalability, and easy scheduling of ETL workflows.

# Tech Stack

Apache Airflow – Workflow orchestration and scheduling

Python         – Data extraction and transformation logic

PostgreSQL / MySQL – Target database for storing transformed data

Docker & Docker Compose – Containerized deployment

# Features

Automated Workflows: Airflow DAGs manage the ETL tasks.

Data Extraction: Pulls raw data from APIs, CSV files, or databases.

Data Transformation: Cleans, formats, and structures data for analysis.

Data Loading: Inserts processed data into the target database.

Monitoring & Scheduling: Airflow UI provides visibility into pipeline runs.

Containerized Setup: Runs easily on any environment using Docker.

# Installation and Working Process
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Download the project files from the GitHub repository and place them in a dedicated project directory. Verify that the Airflow DAGs, Python scripts, and configuration files are correctly organized within the repository. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the command docker-compose up --build to start all services. This will set up the Airflow scheduler, web server, and database inside Docker containers. Once the setup is complete, access the Airflow web UI at http://localhost:8080. From there, you can trigger the ETL DAG manually or allow it to run automatically on its scheduled interval.
